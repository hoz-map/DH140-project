# Project Proposal (Updated)

**Background**

Natural disasters have significantly increased over the past 20 years due to climate change ([United Nations News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/10/1075142), 2020). 
With rising global temperatures, more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere. 
This phenomenon accelerates drought, wildfires, and calamitous storms in the world. 
Although the magnitudes of the impacts vary by country, these disasters negatively influence society, including economic damage, and cause risks to food production, water supplies, ecosystems, and infrastructures. 
Indonesia is one of the countries that is facing these challenges led by climate disasters. 
In 2019, earthquakes and flood events led to 486,000 new displacements ([Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre](https://www.internal-displacement.org/countries/indonesia#:~:text=Disasters%20led%20to%20486%2C000%20new,and%20125%20flood%20events%20139%2C000.&text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of,as%20a%20result%20of%20disasters.)). 
Therefore, *my research questions are: 1) which countries are more prone to natural disasters? 2) are there any common points among the high disaster risk countries? 3) why is Indonesia one of the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters? 4) how does population growth potentially increase flood frequency?*

**Methodology**

The first part of the project is an analysis of the global disaster trends by visualizing geographical locations of high disaster risk countries in order to understand what areas are more likely to have more natural disasters and be affected by those disasters. 
After identifying the top five high disaster risk countiries, I look at the trends of disaster types for the those countries. 
The second part of the project is an analysis of the disaster, sepecifically flood, in Indonesia. 
Then, I narrow the focus down to floods in Jakarta, a capital of Indonesia, and analyze how population increase can develop the risk of flood. 
In terms of data sources, I will mainly use the [Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters](https://www.emdat.be/) and the [Demographic and Health Surveys Program Spatial Data Repository](http://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/population-estimates/). 

**Objective**

The goal of this project is to gain an understanding of what impacts natural disasters bring on the global scale, as well as how people in those countries are affected by disasters and why population increase can develop at-risk populations for the disaster impacts. 
With the analysis of the relation between natural disasters and at risk populations, I hope the findings will raise awareness of climate change and its consequence.

**Title**:  Global Vulnerabilities of Disasater and a Case Study of Indonesia
**Role**: 

Since I am a free agent, I am playing the following roles by myself:

>Primary writer: write a narrative

>Data visualization specialist: visualize data with graphs and maps

>Web specialist: develop a story map 

**Status update**: 

Although sometimes it takes significant time to figure out the process of coding and visualization, my team (I) enjoys working on the project. 
In terms of the details of what is working, I first thought it would be challenging to do this project alone because it was my first time learning to code. 
However, as I mentioned, though it sometimes takes a lot of time to find data and figure out the cause of the error of my code, doing this project alone is working. 
On the other hand, there are not many issues now. 
The only issue is I was not able to get much geographical information of Indonesia from Open Street Map when I tried to find the hospital and residential locations.

**Data update**: 

Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary. 
For now, I have been using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters to visualize disaster trends in the world and in the top five disaster-prone countries. 
After visualizing the data, I am interested in some common factors that cause more flood, such as deforestation and expansion of residential areas in a coastal zone or other high flood risk zones. 
Therefore, the next step will be to find the data that help me understand how much area in Indonesia was deforested and whether or not those areas are linked to the flood frequent areas.

**Concerns**: 

Although I have been able to find several data about Indonesia and its disasters, I am still concerned about the insufficiency of the dataset availability. (Minor concerns)
